## Legacy modules

These modules have served me well, and are now retired. I keep them here in case
someone may find a use for them.

- Pulseaudio - tweak settings to minimize PA latency and bring it closer to
  realtime capabilities. Replaced with PipeWire.
- Neovim - configuration, replaced with a Home Manager entry.
- Keyboard Patching - patches `xkeyboard-config` and programs dependent on it
  with DreymaR's Colemak Mods or any other patch you specify. Reasons for
  deprecation in the file itself.
