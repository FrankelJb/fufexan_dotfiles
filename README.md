# NixOS & HM Configuration

[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

In-house baked configs for Home-Manager and NixOS. Borrowed bits sprinkled on
top. Using [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

## Contents

You can check out all this flake has to offer with
`nix flake show github:fufexan/dotfiles`.
Most directories have a `README` explaining what it's for.

My [$HOME](./home) config managed with [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
is also in this flake!

## People

These are the people whom I've taken inspiration from while writing these
configs. There surely are more but I tend to forget. Regardless, I am thankful
to all of them.
