# NixOS Configuration

Following a recent transition from Void Linux to NixOS, I have baked a few
configs in this repository. The config is modular, so you can comment out
modules to fit your needs.

I'm planning on slimming it down as I move more of my packages to Home Manager
(repo to come soonâ„¢).

## Components

As of now, it includes configurations for:

- Bootloader - customize the bootloader
- Droidcam - uses NUR, but will be rewritten as a Nix Overlay
- Fonts - configure fonts
- Network - define hostname, firewall rules, network services
- Pulse - Pulseaudio changes to make it realtime
- Packages - a list of packages to install and also programs with configs
- Shell - define the global shell and its options, and console configs
- Users - define the users and their groups
- Xorg - default DM/DE/WM and keyboard config

In the future, I will be adding more to fit my needs, or they may be moved to
home.nix.

## Installing

In order to install the config, you need to clone this repo, then symlink it to
`/etc/nixos`.

**NOTE:** Make sure to copy your hardware-configuration.nix before symlinking.
I will write a script somewhere in the near future that automates this.
